                    <p class="image-description">I have visited so many places of historical and tourist interest. But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of New Delhi. Delhi is the present-day capital of India, a city that has seen every type of government and Kings and Queens and always attracted the whole world.</p>

                    <p class="image-description">Lotus temple or Baha I House of worship is one of the most visited places in the world. There I was admired by its universal design in the form of a lotus. Being present over there I feel the oneness of God, oneness of religion and oneness of mankind. Inside the temple there was one big hall and there were benches where you can sit and pray to your God. Every religion people coming over there and pray to their god. I feel so energetic in my spiritual mind when I perform a meditation for 2-3 minutes. After having lunch we moved to Akshardham, largest Hindu temple in the world. I enjoyed the musical fountain inside the temple. Waters of different colour with music playing with the strike of cold air in my body simultaneously, I feel like in heaven.</p>

                    <p class="image-description">The first thing one experiences on the streets as a student coming from another state is the fear, the need to ensure one’s own safety, the opportunism that devours you sooner or later. An atmosphere of mutual arrogance and autocracy takes over you and you feel more and more entitled to your judgements and self-interests. The relationships, the friendships, the commitments — if one looks at Delhi through this lens — all soon get coloured in a similar opportunism. The result is a constant flow of insecurity, envy, distrust and hatred.</p>
