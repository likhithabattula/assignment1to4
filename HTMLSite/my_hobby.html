	<h1>My Hobby</h1>
	
	<p>Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies. When I take pictures, it’s like seeing things in a new perspective literally and figuratively. you can go up to a flower and see the texture of the petal or put a caterpillar on your finger and see the little hairlike things on it’s body. Thing about the camera and the lens is that it lets you see people, places, etc. in a whole new perspective and it helps to see things from a different view. From photography, I realized that getting a different view of things means you have a more open mind to the world. Which is why it’s always been my favorite hobby.</p>
